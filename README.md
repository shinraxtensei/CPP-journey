# C++ journey
<p>This project contains several exercises to help you learn and practice C++ programming. The exercises are split into eight modules, each covering a different topic.</p>
<h2>Modules</h2>

<h3>Module 1: Introduction to C++ Classes and Objects</h3>
<p>This module provides an introduction to classes and objects in C++.  you\'ll learn how to create classes and objects, and how to use them in your code.</p>

<h3>Module 2: Function Overloading and Fixed Point Type</h3>
<p>In this module, you\'ll learn about function overloading, and how to create your own fixed point type in C++.</p>

<h3>Module 3: Inheritance</h3>
<p>This module covers inheritance in C++.  you\'ll learn how to create derived classes that inherit from base classes, and how to use inheritance to create more complex class hierarchies.</p>

<h3>Module 4: Polymorphism</h3>
<p>In this module,  you\'ll learn about polymorphism in C++.  you\'ll learn how to use virtual functions and abstract classes to create polymorphic behavior in your code.</p>

<h3>Module 5: Exceptions</h3>
<p>This module covers exceptions in C++. you\'ll learn how to use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions, and how to create your own custom exceptions.</p>

<h3>Module 6: Typecasting</h3>
<p>In this module,  you\'ll learn about typecasting in C++.  you\'ll learn how to use static_cast, dynamic_cast, reinterpret_cast, and const_cast to cast between different types.</p>

<h3>Module 7: Templates</h3>
<p>This module covers templates in C++.  you\'ll learn how to use templates to create generic functions and classes that can work with different types of data.</p>

<h3>Module 8: STL Containers, Algorithms, and Iterators</h3>
<p>In this module,  you\'ll learn about the Standard Template Library (STL) containers, algorithms, and iterators in C++.  you\'ll learn how to use the vector, stack, map, and set containers, and how to use algorithms like sort, find, and transform to manipulate data. you\'ll also learn about iterators, which are used to traverse and manipulate data in containers.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>To use this project, simply clone the repository and navigate to the module you want to work on. Each module contains a set of exercises in its own directory. Each exercise is contained in its own C++ file, along with a makefile that you can use .</p>
